I put this together after watching Adam Bertram's (https://adamtheautomator.com/) course on Pluralsight in regards to using Pester for infrastructure testing.  Using Pester 5.1.1., I found that the tests ran correctly inconsistantly.  For instance, sometimes it would pull the correct server names but fail to apply it correctly in the loop.  I'll revisit in the future and try a new Pester release.
